Yay, let's calculate how many days you have to go to the office this week (might completely fail).

To execute, either clone the files and run locally as any Angular app or:

1. Download office-days-app.zip
2. Uncompress
3. Open folder in CMD
4. Run: python -m http.server 8080
5. Go to http://localhost:8080/
